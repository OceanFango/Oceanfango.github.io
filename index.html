<h2>More about me:</h2>
<h4>some ways to describe me:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Secretive--I dont like people knowing things about me.
    <li>Irresponsible--I keep losing all of my stuff.
    <li>Unimaginitave--I ran out of ways to describe myself so I used this.
</ol>
<br>
<h4>favorite class:</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">My favorite class is Biology because we either do nothing, something fun, or something easy. Usually its nothing though. Sometimes we do busywork but thats easy most of the time.</p>
<br>
<h4>Hobbies:</h4>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">I play baseball, soccer, and the cello. Memes also take up a good amount of time in my life.</p>

<h4>Present and future questions:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>I dont really have a phisical goal for this year and if I had a plan, knowing myself I probably would'nt stick to it so why try? I might start one in highschool or college.
    <li>I've never really thought of having an emotional goal and at the same time I only half understand what this question means.
    <li>I had a social goal earlier this year which was just to talk to more people since I can stay after school more this year but I feel like I've already met it. I've even started talking to more people that went to my old school.
</ol>
